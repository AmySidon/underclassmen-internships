# Contributing to this list

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing! This has been a solo project of mine for over a year now. There are many lists like this on GitHub for underclassmen but most stopped updating. With your help, I can make sure this one last!

## A few notes on what this list is and how it's structured

- This list is only for CS related opportunities located in the US
- All opportunities should be exclusive to underclassmen, however there are some exceptions
- Opportunities are grouped into appropriate categories. A description of the category is in the readme
- List is ordered by class year, from freshman exclusive, to freshman & sophomore, to sophomore exclusive, to all student
